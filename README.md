# telephoneDirectory_Git
Building a simple telephone directory from scratch to learn about the working of git protocol.

Might think of adding a GUI later.

Current Issues:
1. No inbuild search feature in Update/Delete. Separate search has to be carried out.
2. Case of the string has to match for Update/Delete. 
3. Trie data structure might reduce the Time Complexity.
